# GÃ¼id

Third project of the [Responsive Web Design Certification by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).


## Motivation

I tried to create a website for a small business of a friend. The idea of the design tried to follow the colours of the logo.


## General Info

This project, as well as others, vary a bit from the original FCC requirements (for example, # 13: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport). Although the correct version is in Codepen. For aesthetic reasons, I decided not to include it.


## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
